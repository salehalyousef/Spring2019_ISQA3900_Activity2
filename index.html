            I am Saleh Alyousef studying MIS at UNO. This is my final semester and I am all excited to enter Corporate world.
            I am an avid reader who loves reading (mainly novels) and a lot of Tech Magazines. In this 21st century, computers being the
            primary driving force in various sectors, I want to learn a lot about them and also learn how technology can be applied to solve everyday's problems. My aim is to be become a CTO one day.
